## OPUS Converter

## Description
This library implements conversions from various formats (ogg/opus, WebM etc.) to encoded OPUS streams (.bin). Additionally it provides parsing support for several of these formats. The encoding format encodes frame-wise with each frame size being indicated by an 8-bit number representing the size of the frame in bytes followed by the frame.
